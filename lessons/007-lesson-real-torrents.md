# Real BitTorrent Implementation

## Current State vs Real Implementation
**Current (Simulation):**
- Mock download progress
- Fake peer connections
- No actual file data transfer
- Test torrents only

**Real Implementation Needed:**
- TCP connections to actual peers
- BitTorrent peer protocol implementation
- Piece verification using SHA-1 hashes
- File assembly from downloaded pieces
- Real tracker communication

## Key Components for Real Downloads

### 1. Peer Connection Manager
- Establish TCP connections to peers from tracker
- Implement BitTorrent handshake protocol
- Handle peer messages (choke, unchoke, have, bitfield, request, piece)
- Manage multiple concurrent peer connections

### 2. Piece Manager
- Track which pieces we have/need
- Implement piece selection strategy (rarest first)
- Verify piece integrity using SHA-1 hashes
- Handle piece requests and responses

### 3. File Manager
- Create output files based on torrent info
- Write piece data to correct file positions
- Handle multi-file torrents
- Ensure file integrity

### 4. Download Coordinator
- Coordinate between peer connections and piece management
- Implement download algorithms
- Handle peer choking/unchoking
- Manage upload/download ratios

## Implementation Challenges

### Browser Limitations
- No raw TCP socket support in browsers
- Can't bind to ports for incoming connections
- Limited to HTTP/WebSocket protocols

### Solutions
- Use Node.js backend for all peer communication
- WebSocket for frontend-backend communication
- Backend acts as BitTorrent client proxy
- Stream progress updates to frontend

## Architecture Plan
```
Frontend (React) ←→ WebSocket ←→ Backend (Node.js) ←→ TCP ←→ BitTorrent Peers
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Real tracker communication** - Get actual peer lists
2. **Peer connection protocol** - TCP handshake and messaging
3. **Piece downloading** - Request and receive actual pieces
4. **File assembly** - Write pieces to disk
5. **Progress tracking** - Real progress based on actual pieces

## Next Steps
We'll start by implementing real peer connections and the BitTorrent peer protocol.
